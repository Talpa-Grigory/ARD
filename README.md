## Overview
We propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a method that leverages the historical trajectory of diffusion ODEs to mitigate exposure bias and improve efficiency, achieving strong performance on ImageNet and text-to-image synthesis with significantly fewer steps and minimal computational overhead.
